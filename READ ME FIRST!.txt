The goal of this project was to develop a company's parking lot monitoring system using mySQL and Java.
I used Java's Swing to create a user-friendly interface intended to be used by the company's officials, 
Java's JDBC API to control the querying of data to and from a database and mySQL to create tables and
set constraints where needed. The database was hosted on a UW's server. You will need to enter 
your own UWnet Id and mySQLPassword to use my schema, into the SystemDB file under src/model.



Employees of the company are the main users of the lot, however, various data is collected by the software, whether the employee's parking stall is reversed or not. 

The application tracks the following information about each parking lot:

Name
Location
Capacity 
Number of floors

Monitoring of each parking stall is also in effect to ensure that the use of the parking lot follows guidelines specified by
the company's officials. The following information is tracked for each parking stall: 

Stall number
Whether it is covered or not
The parking lot the stall belongs to


Visitors are also able to park their car into the parking lot as long as they are sponsored by an employee.
The following information is recorded for each visitor:

The visitor's license plate number
The parking stall number
The id number of the employee supervising the visit
Date of the visit
